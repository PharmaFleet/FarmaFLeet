## Offline Mode

### 📴 How the Offline Queue Works

The app works even without internet! Here's how:

#### What Gets Saved Offline

When you're offline, the app saves:
- ✅ Orders assigned to you
- ✅ Order details and addresses
- ✅ Customer phone numbers
- ✅ Navigation info (if loaded beforehand)
- ✅ Delivery photos (saved on phone)

#### What Doesn't Work Offline

- ❌ Receiving new orders
- ❌ Updating order status in real-time
- ❌ Calling customers through the app (use regular phone)
- ❌ Photo upload (photos saved locally)

#### The Offline Queue

Think of it like a waiting line at a restaurant:

```
Your Actions (Offline)     →    App Queue    →    Server (When Online)
     ↓                              ↓                     ↓
"Mark as Picked Up"         →   [Waiting]    →    Sync complete!
"Take delivery photo"       →   [Waiting]    →    Photo uploaded
"Mark delivered"            →   [Waiting]    →    Order updated
```

---

### 📶 What to Do When Connectivity is Poor

#### Before You Lose Signal

**When entering areas with poor coverage:**

1. **Load all order details:**
   - Open each order in your list
   - Let the map load the route
   - Take a screenshot of customer phone numbers

2. **Enable Offline Mode:**
   - Go to Settings → Offline Mode
   - Toggle **"Auto-Enable in Poor Signal"**

#### While Offline

**Continue working normally:**

1. Navigate using your phone's GPS (works offline)
2. Deliver orders as usual
3. Take photos with the app
4. The app saves everything locally

**To contact customers while offline:**
1. Look up their number from the order details (saved offline)
2. Use your regular phone dialer
3. The call won't be tracked in the app (that's okay!)

#### Important Notes

- The app shows a **red banner** when you're offline
- Actions are saved with timestamps
- Photos are stored in your phone's gallery AND the app
- Don't uninstall the app while offline - you'll lose unsynced data!

---

### 🔄 Sync Process When Back Online

#### Automatic Sync

When your phone reconnects to the internet:

1. **The app automatically starts syncing**
2. You'll see a spinning icon at the top
3. Sync usually takes 10-30 seconds
4. All your offline actions upload to the server

#### Manual Sync (If Needed)

If automatic sync doesn't start:

1. Go to the **Dashboard**
2. Pull down to refresh
3. Tap **"Sync Now"** button if available
4. Wait for the "Sync Complete" message

#### What to Check After Sync

| Check | How to Verify |
|-------|---------------|
| Orders updated | Go to Orders → Completed tab |
| Photos uploaded | Tap on completed order, check photo |
| Status correct | Dashboard stats should match |
| Earnings updated | Profile → Earnings section |

> **⚠️ Warning:** Stay online for at least 2 minutes after your last delivery to ensure everything syncs.

## Best Practices

### 📷 Photo Capture Guidelines

#### Why Photos Matter

Photos protect **you**, the **company**, and the **customer**:
- Proof of successful delivery
- Protection against false complaints
- Verification of handoff

#### How to Take Great Delivery Photos

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Good Lighting**
   - Daytime: Stand with sun behind you
   - Nighttime: Use flash or find a light source
   - Indoor: Turn on room lights

2. **Clear View**
   - Hold phone steady
   - Wait for camera to focus
   - Tap screen where package is to focus

3. **Required Elements**
   - ✅ The package clearly visible
   - ✅ Customer holding it (preferred) OR delivery location
   - ✅ House/building number when possible
   - ✅ Pharmacy branding on bag

4. **Framing**
   - Hold phone vertically (portrait mode)
   - Include from waist up if customer in photo
   - Show full package - not just a corner

#### Photo Examples

**✅ GOOD Photo:**
```
┌────────────────────┐
│  🏠 House #42      │
│                    │
│  👤 Customer       │
│     😊             │
│  📦 Holding bag    │
│  with logo visible │
└────────────────────┘
```

```
┌────────────────────┐
│  🤳 Just hand      │
│     and bag        │
│  ❌ No face        │
│  ❌ No location    │
│  ❌ Too dark       │
└────────────────────┘
```

#### Special Situations

### 🤝 Customer Interaction Tips

#### First Impression Matters

**When you meet the customer:**

1. **Smile and greet professionally**
   - "Good morning! I'm [Your Name] from PharmaFleet."
   - "I have your delivery from [Pharmacy Name]."

2. **Be respectful of their time**
   - "I'll just need a moment to verify your order."
   - Work quickly but carefully

3. **Professional appearance**
   - Wear your PharmaFleet ID badge
   - Clean, professional clothes
   - Well-groomed appearance

#### Communication Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Speak clearly and politely
- ✅ Confirm their name before handing over
- ✅ Explain what you're delivering
- ✅ Ask if they have questions
- ✅ Thank them for choosing PharmaFleet
- ✅ Wish them good health

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Rush or seem impatient
- ❌ Discuss medication details (privacy)
- ❌ Enter their home without permission
- ❌ Handle medications without gloves if required
- ❌ Take tips (company policy)

#### Handling Difficult Situations

**Customer is unhappy about delivery time:**
> "I apologize for the delay. Traffic was heavier than expected. Thank you for your patience."

**Customer has questions about medication:**
> "I understand you have questions, but I'm the delivery driver. Please contact the pharmacy at [number] for medication information. I can only deliver the package."

**Customer wants to change order:**
> "I'm not able to modify orders, but you can call the pharmacy directly at [number] and they'll help you."

**Customer not home but neighbor offers to take it:**
> "I can only leave this with [Customer Name] or someone they specifically authorized. Let me try calling them."

#### Privacy and Confidentiality

**Pharmaceutical deliveries are sensitive:**

- Never discuss a customer's medications with anyone
- Don't read prescription labels out loud in public
- Keep delivery bags sealed until handoff
- If someone asks "what's in the package?" say: "I'm not at liberty to discuss the contents."
